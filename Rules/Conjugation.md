verb conjugation is the important aspect of the German language . The process of changing the form of a verb to reflect various grammatical categories such as a person (who is doing the action), number (singular or plural), tense (when the action happens), mood, and sometimes gender.

**Applying conjugation the verb will look differently depending on who is performing the action and the action takes place**


Example :

verb - machen **( To do / To make )**

- **ich mache** (I do)

- **du machst** (you do)

- **er/sie/es macht** (he/she/it does)

- **wir machen** (we do)

- **ihr macht** (you all do)

- **sie machen** (they do)
